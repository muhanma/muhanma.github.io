    <h1>Eras Map </h1>
    <p>The Eras Map provides historical perspective to the context
being studied. Understanding how things change over time offers
a fuller picture of the context and helps teams think about
where things may be headed in the future and where
opportunities might exist. The Eras Map highlights the key
characteristics of each relevant period, shows how each era is
different, and indicates how much they have changed over time.
Constructing this as an overview map helps us see the larger
patterns of change in the context being studied. <br>Distinct eras showing 
how different attributes of the
project topic have evolved over time

    <h1>Competitors Map </h1>

    <p>A top view of an industry map can effectively show how the
various organizations in that industry compete or complement
one another. This method maps an organization and its
competitors to key business dimensions such as price, quality,
revenue, market share, or type of audience. The resulting map
picture shows how each company’s performance stands relative
to others. A broader view of the map allows for the inclusion
of complementors as well—companies that benefit the
organization, giving them strategic advantage over the
competition.
A Competitor-Complementor Map can take a number of forms—a 2
× 2 map, scatterplot, or a network. These kinds of
visualizations translate numeric data into graphic forms that
can be understood at a glance without the need for timeconsuming
analyses.</p>

    <h1> Ten Types of Innovation Diagnostics</h1>

    <p>This is a diagnostic method that uses Doblin’s Ten Types of
Innovation framework for understanding the organization’s
innovations and identifying new opportunities. The ten types
include business model and networking innovations in finance;
enabling and core processes in process; product performance,
product systems, and service in offering; and channel, brand,
and customer experience in delivery. The Ten Types of
Innovation framework provides a structure for assessing the
innovations the organization has developed in each type. As
descriptions of innovations get put into the framework, what
emerges is an innovation profile that is useful for identifying
the strongest innovations as well as points of weakness. The
method also helps compare the organization’s innovations with
those of other organizations..</p>

  <li class="card">
    <h1> SWOT Analysis</h1>

    <p>The SWOT Analysis, a method widely popular for decades, is used
to evaluate an organization’s strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats. The analysis begins with studying
the organization and its innovations and seeks to understand
how the organization performs in relation to competitors in the
market. A high-level assessment is made of the strengths and
weaknesses of the organization, the opportunities available as
well as competitive threats. It looks at factors inside and
outside the organization to determine whether defined business
objectives are achievable or not. Because of its general
nature, a SWOT Analysis can be done with relative ease and
speed in the early part of knowing the context.</p>
