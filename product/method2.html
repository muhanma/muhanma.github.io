    <h1>Research Participant Map </h1>
    <p>
      Research Participant Maps help us see an overview of all the
people involved in the project topic, based on their roles and
activities, in order to ensure that the right people are
researched for a given project intent. A Research Participant
Map begins with a consideration of the kinds of people we want
to study and the aspects of their daily lives or activities we
want to understand. This will allow us to think of at least two
attributes of the project topic that are important for
understanding the full range of people involved. A simple 2 ×
2 map allows a variety of people to be plotted along these two
attributes. The resulting map provides an overview of the kinds
of participants to be included in the study and how they differ
in relation to one another. This overview can help us make
decisions about where the focus of the research efforts should
go.

    <h1>Research Planning Survey </h1>

    <p>
      TUnlike traditional market research surveys, Research Planning
Surveys are short, quick, loosely constructed questionnaires
used at the early phase of a research project to understand
peoples’ activities, behaviors, and attitudes about a
particular topic of interest. They provide quick overviews of a
topic, identify interesting trend patterns, and help the team
decide where to focus their detailed research. Simultaneously,
Research Planning Surveys can be used to screen and select the
participants for later ethnographic research. The initial
results from the survey may also prompt a modification of
research plans, if the results differed greatly from what was
expected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1> User Research Plan</h1>

    <p>A User Research Plan is a method for organizing the research
portion of a project. The method is a disciplined approach to
define all aspects of the work to be done. It sets forth the
stated goals of the research including, types of people to be
studied, the desired number of participants required, what is
hoped to be learned, a protocol for interacting with
participants, a statement about methods used to collect user
information, the possible output at various stages, work
sessions, a timeline, and a budget.
</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1> Five Human Factors</h1>

    <p>The Five Human Factors is a method for supporting observation
in the field, prompting researchers to look for the physical,
cognitive, social, cultural, and emotional elements present in
any situation to understand how they affect peoples’ overall
experiences. Understanding five factors of a person in a
structured way and thinking about all these factors together
will give us a rich, deeper understanding of the experience of
that person. The resulting holistic assessment can bring focus
to the various elements that need to be considered when
developing concepts and solutions. In this way, this research
method breaks down a person’s experience into its constituent
parts to understand each in detail, and then reassembles our
findings to understand how they form an overall experience.
</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1> POEMS</h1>

    <p>The POEMS framework is an observational research framework used
to make sense of the elements present in a context. The five
elements are: People, Objects, Environments, Messages, and
Services. Application of the POEMS framework encourages
researchers to examine these elements independently as well as
an interrelated system. For example, a team researching a
specific product using the POEMS framework would look beyond
object (the product) to services, messages, environments, and
people that have a relationship with the broader context in
which that product is used. In broadening perspective, the
framework helps teams think about contexts as systems of
related elements.
</p>

  </li>
 <li class="card">
    <h1> Field Visit</h1>

    <p>The field visit is the most direct means of building empathy
with people. Spending time with people engaged in real-world
activities helps innovation researchers understand relevant
behaviors firsthand. Unlike surveys or focus groups, where
researchers’ questions dictate the conversation, a field visit
emphasizes observation and inquiry about what is being
observed. Researchers ask participants to talk about specific
activities and things they use. Conversations are guided by
simple open-ended questions such as “Can you tell me about
what you’re doing?” and “Can you tell me more?” The method
is a way to get acquainted with users in an unbiased fashion
and frequently provides glimpses of nonobvious or surprising
behaviors and insights about unmet needs.
</p>

  </li> 

  <li class="card">
    <h1> Cultural Artifacts</h1>

    <p>This method leverages the emotional charge and cultural meaning
artifacts have on people. The connotation of “culture” here
is not restricted only to nationality or ethnicity.
Sociocultural groups have particular customs, behaviors,
traditions, thoughts, and practices of everyday life. In other
words, every group has its own culture. The Cultural Artifacts
method reappropriates a specific element of that culture,
either tangible such as a physical object or intangible such as
a specific belief the group has, into an artifact relevant to
that group and uses that artifact to discover peoples’
perceptions traditionally overlooked by other research methods.
</p>

  </li> 
<li class="card">
    <h1> Ethnographic Interview</h1>

    <p>A close companion to field visit observational research,
Ethnographic Interview is concerned with understanding
peoples’ activities and experiences from their own
perspectives and in their own places. It lets the researcher
learn about people through their stories and in their own
words, in an open-ended and exploratory fashion, with less risk
for bias than interviews based on scripted questions.
Typically, Ethnographic Interviews are conducted in the actual
location or context where the activities being discussed occur.
This makes the conversation much more directed and less
abstract. It allows subjects to demonstrate activities and
share their experiences with researchers. Discussing
experiences in their actual context can often aid peoples’
memory. Finally, people are usually more comfortable and
talkative in their own environment than in an artificial or
unfamiliar setting like a focus group.
