    <h1>Observations to Insights </h1>
    <p>Research produces a number of observations about people and
context. In this method we systematically think through all
these observations and extract valuable insights. An insight,
according to common definition, is the act of “seeing into” a
situation or understanding the “inner nature” of what we
observe. It is our learning from an observation through our
interpretation by asking the question why. It encapsulates a
point of view, a generally acceptable interpretation that we
can somewhat objectively rationalize. The most useful insights
are nonobvious and surprising.
An example description of an observation is: “People so often
move a chair a few inches this way and that before sitting on
it.” An example insight description for the above is: “Before
taking possession of things, people demonstrate their control
over them as a declaration of autonomy to themselves.”
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>Insights Sorting </h1>

    <p>The method starts with gathering all the insights we have
generated from research. We write insight statements on sticky
notes and start sorting them to find an agreed-upon clustering
logic. Once the team agrees on this clustering logic, we resort
all the insights to reveal interesting clustering patterns.
Analyzing these clustering patterns not only gives us a better
understanding of the topic but also provides a strong
foundation for generating concepts. To get the most value out
of this method, we should use a manageable number of insights—
not more than 100 insights for a small project. This method is
a quick and rough analog version of the digital spreadsheetbased
matrix sorting.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1> User Response Analysis</h1>

    <p>User Response Analysis is a method that uses data visualization
techniques, such as color and size, to analyze large quantities
of qualitative data gathered from user surveys, questionnaires,
interviews, and other ethnographic research methods. This
method takes all of the qualitative, text-based data from
ethnographic research—what users have said—and inputs it into
a spreadsheet for data manipulation using keyword filters, data
organization by arranging information in specific columns and
rows, and visual coding using color to identify patterns. The
visual approach helps uncover patterns from the data and find
insights into what matters most to users.</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>Value Web</h1>

    <p>A Descriptive Value Web visualizes the existing set of
relationships among stakeholders in a given context, showing
how value is exchanged and flows through the system. Most
frequently it is represented as a network diagram in which
stakeholders are presented as nodes connected by links with
descriptions of what value is flowing from node to node. Common
value flows include: money, information, materials, and
services. Descriptive Value Webs should be viewed as snapshots
of a dynamic system and, therefore, should be revisited and
built upon as new information becomes available. A descriptive
value web is used in the analysis mode to understand the state
of current conditions, while a prescriptive value web is
created in the synthesis mode to describe possible future
states.</p>

  </li>

  <li class="card">
    <h1>Entities Position Map</h1>

    <p>The Entities Position Map is a method for analyzing how
entities group together in relation to two intersecting
attribute scales. Each entity is plotted within the boundaries
of the position map. The method helps illuminate not just where
entities fall within this defined space, but their relative
position to one another. Once entities have been plotted,
mainly five kinds of analysis could be performed..</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>Venn Diagramming</h1>

    <p>Venn Diagramming is an effective method to analyze the overlaps
between two or more clusters of entities. The most common
context in which the method is used is for industry-level
analysis. For example, if examining innovations in the video
game industry, understanding overlaps between developments in
the electronics, entertainment, and computer industries would
be beneficial. Venn diagrams use visualizations with
overlapping circles. The interior of a circle represents the
entities in that cluster, while the exterior represents
entities that are not members of that cluster. Venn diagrams
typically support not more than three or four overlapping
clusters; beyond this, the diagram becomes difficult to read
and complicated to understand.</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>Activity Network</h1>

    <p>This method allows us to take a list of activities gathered
during research and see how they are grouped based on their
relationships. The method uses a Symmetric Clustering Matrix to
relate activities of all the stakeholders (users, providers,
maintainers, etc.) in the context we are studying and clusters
them together. The results of clustering are then turned into a
network diagram that visualizes all the activities together,
showing their overall interrelationships. The diagram shows how
activities constitute larger clusters of activities and how, in
turn, these clusters connect to higher-level ones in a
hierarchical pattern. The method is particularly effective for
constructing a big picture of peoples’ activities and their
needs that, in turn, can help reveal opportunities for
innovation.</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>User Groups Definition</h1>

    <p>User Groups Definition is a method that maps different types of
users according to a set of key attributes related to the
project topic. It creates a 2 × 2 map based on two important
attribute scales and represents users in relation to one
another on that map. This helps us look at the different user
types in each quadrant of the map and define them as a user
group. Then, we determine the common characteristics of these
user groups, define concise descriptive user group names, and
write detailed descriptions for each group. This yields a more
nuanced portrait of the user landscape.</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>User Journey Map</h1>

    <p>The User Journey Map is a flow map that tracks users’ steps
through an entire experience. This method breaks down users’
journey into component parts to gain insights into problems
that may be present or opportunities for innovations.
Activities users perform (rinse, mix, heat, serve) are shown as
nodes in this map. These activities are also shown in groups as
higher-level activities (preparation, cooking, finishing).
Problems and insights are called out on this map to highlight
areas where attention is needed and where opportunities exist.</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>Design Principles
Generation</h1>

    <p>Design principles fill the “intuition gap” that exists in
most innovation projects between understanding needs and having
a “magical” leap of intuition about solutions that meet those
needs. This method is a way to purposefully transition from the
insights that we have framed to begin to explore concepts in a
disciplined manner, so that concepts we develop are fully
grounded in objective research data rather than biased by
subjective assumptions. This method helps us turn our
descriptive insights into actionable, forward-looking
prescriptive statements. Design Principles help build alignment
among the team as well in that they become steppingstones to
move to the ideation process.</p>
