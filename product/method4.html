    <h1>Principles to Opportunities</h1>
    <p>Design principles fill the “intuition gap,” giving us a good
structure to move from understanding needs to defining
principles to exploring opportunities to generating concepts.
This method is a way to purposefully transition from the Frame
Insights mode to the Explore Concepts mode in a disciplined
manner, so that concepts are fully grounded in objective
research data rather than biased by subjective assumptions.
Exploring opportunities before jumping into generating concepts
is an important step that helps us first identify areas that
can be more fertile than others. Design principles also help
build alignment among the team. Using them in teams as
steppingstones helps bring focus to the process and avoid
misunderstandings and unproductive debates.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>Opportunity Mind Map </h1>

    <p>This method is used at the beginning of concept exploration.
Using frameworks from previous methods such as the Summary
Framework or Design Principles Generation, teams start to
create visual depictions of where innovation opportunities may
reside. These visual depictions start with the core topic in
the center, and possible opportunities are explored from this
center, to the periphery. Opportunities are shown in relation
to the various project aspects depicted on the map. The map,
showing relationships and hierarchies, becomes a tool for teams
to have early conversations about where it is more interesting
for potential solutions to be developed. The method helps guide
further exploration and concept development.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1> Persona Definition</h1>

    <p>In this method, user personalities—personas related to the
intended innovation—are defined and documented first.
Analyzing the types of potential users and organizing them
according to sets of shared attributes define the personas. It
is helpful to think of a persona as a personality type. A
finite number of such personas are created and considered as
representing the target users for the project. This range of
selected personas frames the opportunity space so that
innovation teams can focus on them for building concepts.
Concepts are built to address the needs of these personas and
to fit with their context.</p>

  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1> Ideation Session</h1>

    <p>Compared to traditional free-form brainstorming, an Ideation
Session is more structured. Concepts are generated using
preorganized sets of insights, principles, and frameworks that
teams have already developed. The method encourages generating
as many concepts as possible without making judgments and is
done in a short amount of time. The session brings together
people with multidisciplinary backgrounds and encourages
building on each other’s ideas.
Teams agree on a number of protocols that make these ideation
sessions productive. Be proactive in generating “bold” ideas.
Generate a lot of them. Build on each other’s ideas using the
“Yes…and…” approach, in which a member builds on another’s
idea by acknowledging it and then adding more value to it.
Always stay focused on the topic for ideation and be engaged
throughout the session. No idea is a bad idea in this session;
therefore, capture every idea that comes up. Evaluate ideas
later.</p>
