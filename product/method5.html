    <h1>Prescriptive Value Web </h1>
    <p>
A Prescriptive Value Web is a network diagram showing all the
stakeholders in the system as nodes. The values that are
exchanged through the system are shown as links connecting the
nodes. It shows new relationships among stakeholders if a
possible concept is to be implemented. Unlike Descriptive Value
Webs, Prescriptive Value Webs show how the value will flow when
new nodes or links are introduced or existing nodes or links
are modified or delinked. The Prescriptive Value Web is a
generative tool that helps us think of possible future states
in the system. Similar to Descriptive Value Webs, Prescriptive
Value Webs use money, information, materials, and services as
common value flows. They can also be used to track other
intangible values such as goodwill, customer loyalty, and
emotional connections.

    <h1>Foresight Scenario </h1>

    <p>Foresight Scenario is a method for considering hypothetical
futures based on emergent trends and then formulating
alternative solutions designed to meet those possible
situations. In this method, we often use 2 × 2 position maps
to write about scenarios, possible future situations. The two
dimensions of the position map are based on the emergent trends
(social, cultural, technological, economic, and business)
identified to be critical for the project and to have maximum
impact on users and the context. Then, we write scenarios for
each quadrant of the position map. Based on these scenarios,
concepts are generated, if not already developed in the earlier
modes, and then plotted onto the map. The plotted map can then
be used to combine complementary concepts to form holistic
solutions.
    </p>

  <li class="card">
    <h1>Solution Diagramming</h1>

    <p>Diagrams are visual tools to explain and communicate
information in rational and universally understandable ways.
They are neither as abstract as the words that we use in our
language system nor as real as a photograph or a scale model
that we use to represent something realistically. It is because
of this that diagramming is a very powerful tool to work with
your concepts and solutions.
Solution Diagramming translates solutions into visual
representations. The type of diagram to use depends on the
aspect of the solution you want to highlight. Diagrams can
effectively clarify structural relationships, describe
processes, show how value flows through the system, show how
the system evolves over time, map interactions between
components, or work with other similar aspects of the system.
Diagramming is an effective tool not only to illustrate
solutions but also to generate them. The process of translating
your ideas into diagrams helps reduce ambiguity.</p>

  <li class="card">
    <h1> Solution Storyboard</h1>

    <p>The Solution Storyboard is a set of sketches (in both image and
words), arranged in sequence, outlining the scenes of a story
describing how all the parts of the concept system work
together in situations. A solution storyboard uses narrative
elements of character, action, and plot to build stories about
what a user’s experience might be as the user moves through an
imagined situation. It begins by mapping a hypothetical
journey. The narrative describes not just what happens but how
various concepts are going to add value during the journey.
Stories have the fundamental ability to translate abstractions
like a “system” into human terms that can be easily grasped.
That is why stories can connect with audiences on emotional and
experiential levels in a way that diagrams or charts simply
cannot.
Design teams use the Solution Storyboard not just to
communicate concepts but to improve the concepts. A storyboard
can be thought of as prototyping through language.

  <li class="card">
    <h1> Solution Prototype</h1>

    <p>A Solution Prototype is a method in which users are observed
engaging in planned activities around prototypes of proposed
solutions. Two types of Solution Prototypes are used in this
method: (1) Appearance Prototype, which simulates the
appearance of the intended offerings, and (2) Performance
Prototype, which primarily simulates the functions of the
intended offerings. Through observations on these prototypes,
user experiences are revealed to validate or invalidate
assumptions about proposed solutions. Solution Prototypes are
tested and validated in simulated environments. Information is
gathered through observing the interactions and is recorded
with video or note taking. The observations are then analyzed
to understand users’ experiences and the impact they might
have on proposed solutions.

    </p>
  </li>

    <li class="card">
    <h1> Solution Evaluation</h1>
    <p>
The Solution Evaluation method helps evaluate solutions once
they have taken a tangible form. Solutions are plotted on a map
with a user value score and a provider value score. The map
reveals patterns of distribution and helps us evaluate
prototypes based on their combined user and provider values.
The method provides comparisons that can help us decide which
prototypes to pursue and which to modify.
    </p>

    <li class="card">
    <h1> Solution Roadmap</h1>
    <p>
The Solution Roadmap shows how to plan for implementing
solutions. The roadmap helps explore how solutions are to be
built up, with short-term initiatives serving as a foundation
on which long-term solutions are based. It also shows which
solutions are more suitable for short-term implementation
compared to the ones that are more appropriate further ahead in
the future. In addition, the roadmap indicates how individual
solutions may evolve autonomously, sometimes branching off into
two different solutions, evolving in parallel.
