    <h1> Strategy Roadmap </h1>
    <p> The Strategy Roadmap is a method for mapping the future
strategic direction of the organization by prioritizing the
order of implementation among innovation offerings. It is
employed after all the solutions have been fleshed out,
reviewed, compared with one another, and clustered along a
timeline. Using the distribution of solutions on the timeline
as guidance, distinct strategic goals for the short term, midterm,
and long term are formulated. Strategies are then
developed for each of these three time periods to understand
what will be their implications on the market and what is
required of the organization to support these strategies.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>Platform Plan </h1>

    <p>
 This method allows us to frame our solution as a possible
platform. A platform is an innovation strategy that provides a
common base (a set of standards or an infrastructure) that
enables a variety of options as offerings. A platform strategy
is to build an entire constellation of offerings by allowing
its users and participants to gain value in different ways. For
example, Facebook is a platform that is used by people in a
variety of ways: to share their activities, to make social
connections, to stay in touch, to play games such as Mafia Wars
or Farmville, to promote brands, or for companies to gain
exposure.
  
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="card">
    <h1>Implementation Plan</h1>

    <p>
The Implementation Plan matrix is a method for making the
Strategy Roadmap actionable. With a good understanding of all
the strategies defined using other methods, this method helps
to avoid misalignment between organizational competencies and
implementation goals. For example, it is a challenge if the
organization lacks the right competencies to implement a
critically important solution or a concept. The response to
that challenge might be to create initiatives to grow that
competency in the organization or partner with another
organization that might have that competency. The
Implementation Plan helps teams think through such challenges
and generate appropriate responses. A well-designed plan
provides a structure for implementing innovation solutions,
lays out the specific actions needed, and makes the process
clear to all parts of the organization.

    <h1> Innovation Brief</h1>

    <p>The Innovation Brief is a method for translating innovation
plans into messages and images that make them understandable to
stakeholders and end users. It divides all communications into
three aspects: the message, the intended audience, and medium
through which it is delivered. Empathy, metaphor, analogy,
visualization, and emotional design are all employed in
conjunction with planning activities to think through how we
will present our offerings. The method is a structured approach
to communication that promotes consistency of message in
various forms. It also involves delivering messages differently
to diverse audiences like finance managers, marketing
researchers, engineers, or end users.
